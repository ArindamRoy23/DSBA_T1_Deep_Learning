Deep Learning becomes more and more popular with algorithms based on these techniques performing very well for a variety of problems and scientific communities. The course has been designed to provide an introduction to deep learning techniques, including neural networks, computer vision, natural image processing and reinforcement learning. In particular, it will cover the fundamental aspects and the recent developments in deep learning: Feedforward networks and their optimization and regularization, representation learning and siamese networks, Generative Adversarial Networks and transfer learning, recurrent networks and Long Short Term Memory units.


Learning Objectives
• The course aims to introduce students to the design of deep learning methodologies both in theory and practice. We expect that by the end of the course, the students will:
• Have knowledge of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques
• Have a deeper understanding of deep learning methods
• Have practical experience with deep learning frameworks


Outline of the course
The evaluation of the course was based on:
• One assignment: the assignments will include theoretical questions as well as hands-on practical questions. The assignment will be individual! [50%]
• Kaggle Competition: The students are expected to form groups of 2
people and participate in a kaggle competition. The final grade will be
assigned by the performance and the methodology, described by a
report and a well documented code [50%]
